# MyEmployeeManagementSystem

## Description
This is an employee management system application that I built from scratch using inquirer, console.table, mysql and NodeJS. To build this application I first created sql files which created the database and its tables, and then seeded it with data which I used to test the view functions. I then added inquirer prompts giving the user the option to view one of the three tables or to add a row to one of them.
